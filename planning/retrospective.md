## Strategy vs. Board

##### What parts of your plan went as expected?
We have not finished yet but we are working hard.

##### What parts of your plan did not work out?
The meetings still to long 

##### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?
no,  I dont think so.

##### Or remove extra steps?
We didn't removed any extra step, we changed some ideas, somethings were add, but nothing was removed.

# Retrospective

## Strategy vs. Board

##### What parts of your plan went as expected?
We managed to finish everything we wanted to do at the expected time. 

##### What parts of your plan did not work out?
Our call was always too long and sometimes we didn't get in the topic planned. 

##### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?
We didn't include "could-have" and "should-have" in our strategy, but in the end we had completed both of them. 

##### Or remove extra steps?
We didn't removed any extra step, we changed some ideas, somethings were add, but nothing was removed.
